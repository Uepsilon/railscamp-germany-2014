      <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
      <p><i>Matz is nice, so we are nice.</i></p>

      <p>
        In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused on community happiness. The German Ruby and Rails community is full of wonderful people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all who wish to take part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people we want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, if you are present at any RailsCamp Germany event, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct:
      </p>
      <p>
        The RailsCamp Germany organisers are dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment in any form, neither at the venue, during talks, workshops or parties, nor via Twitter, or other media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, disability; sexual language and imagery, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      <p/>
      <p>
        All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be kind to others. Do not insult, intimidate or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, discriminatory, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for RailsCamp Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the organisers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact the event organisers (who will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ruby and Rails communities are a welcoming and friendly place – thank you for being a part of it.
